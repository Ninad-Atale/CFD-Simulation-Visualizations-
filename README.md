Videos of theh time-dependent velocity and pressure variation of the flow around a pair of loosely-coupled microrobots in a simulated artery (using ANSYS FLUENT). The distance between the robots as a function of their diameter is wrriten in each file name - e.g. 0.1d refers to an edge-to-edge distance between the robots of 0.1 times their diameter.
